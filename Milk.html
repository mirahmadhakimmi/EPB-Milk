     <h2>My backround animal information and production in Finland</h2>
     <p>
      
Finland is a country with a long and rich tradition of dairy cattle breeding. It has also long history in production of semen. Today, Finland is one of the most successful country of breeding dairy cattle.

The number of Finnish dairy farms has fallen rapidly, while the size of farms has increased accordingly. There are under 300,000 dairy cows in Finland. The main breeds are Ayrshire and Holstein.

In 2018, the average milk yield in Finland was 9,795 kg of milk. The fat content was 4.3% and the protein content was 3.5%.
Black and White Holstein-Friesian cattle is the worldâ€™s most common dairy breed, which in originally from the North Holland. In Finland, the breed became more common in the 1960s from Sweden and Denmark. Currently, half of the Finnish dairy cows are Holstein breed.

    <h2>  My farm place in Finland</h2>
    <p>
      Agriculture in Finland is characterized by the northern climate and self-sufficiency in most major agricultural products. Its economic role is declining in terms of GNP and employment in primary production, but together with the food industry and forestry with which it is linked, it forms a significant part of the Finnish economy.[1][2] The number of farms has steadily declined for the last decades. Between 2000 and 2012 their number fell from almost 80,000 in 2000 to about 60,000, while the amount of arable land has slightly increased to a total of almost 2.3 million hectares.[2] Agriculture employed 125,000 people in 2010, which is a drop of 30 percent from 2000.[3]

      A study to examine job resources, work engagement and Finnish dairy farmers' preferences concerning methods to enhance overall well-being while working on farms was conducted. The results indicate that the family, working with cattle, healthy farm animals, a reasonable workload, and a sustainable farm economy have the capacity to create positive impacts on well-being among dairy farmers
